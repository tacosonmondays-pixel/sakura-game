# VFX groundwork: one visual clock, seeded visual randomness, baseline captures

The battle effects upgrade (glow, hits that land, flipbooks, slashes, ult cut-ins) is built in
milestones. This page covers M0, the groundwork every later milestone stands on. Nothing here
changes what a player sees; it makes hit-stop possible and every before/after comparison honest.

Ground rules for all VFX work (they hold for every milestone):

- **Render only.** Nothing under `src/sim`, `src/data/units.js`, `src/online/coop` or anything
  `tools/simId.mjs` hashes changes for an effect. The co-op sim id must stay the same
  (`node -e "import('./tools/simId.mjs').then(m=>console.log(m.simId().id))"`).
- **Effects never use `sim.rng`**, and never `Math.random` (see below).
- **Hit-stop, impact frames and slow motion only change what is drawn.** The battle keeps running;
  a freeze lasts at most 60 ms.
- **Phones first.** Medium and low get no new full-screen passes; their glow comes from halo sprites
  inside the existing sprite limits (900 / 500 / 250 quads, `src/render/attackFx/context.js`).
- **Reduce Motion** (Settings → Reduce motion, `settings.reduceMotion`): no shake, hit-stop, impact
  frames or big flashes, or soft versions. Never more than 3 flashes a second, never a full-white frame.
- **Readability.** Enemies, the road and health bars stay readable.

## The visual clock (`src/render/vfx/clock.js`)

Each battle renderer owns one `VisualClock`, ticked once per frame at the top of
`renderer.update(dt)`. Every animation and effect the renderer draws takes its time from it, never
from `performance.now()` or a clock of its own. It keeps three timelines (seconds):

| Timeline | What it is | Who runs on it |
|---|---|---|
| `dt` / `t` (visual) | the frame's time minus any hit-stop, times any slow motion | particles (`fx.js`), attack FX, girls' and monsters' bodies (`actors.js` → model `animate`), ambient life, rule decals, terrain shaders (`uTime`), camera shake, screen flash and boss vignette |
| `frameDt` / `frameT` | the time the battle handed the renderer (0 while paused) | board feedback that must not wait out a freeze: placement ghost, range and selection rings (`overlays.js`), buff icons |
| `realDt` / `realT` | wall time; runs while paused too | the info-panel slide (`rig.apply` focus) |

Without a hit-stop or slow motion the visual and frame timelines are identical, so M0 draws
exactly what the game drew before.

- `clock.hitStop(seconds)` (or `renderer.hitStop(seconds)`): holds the visual timeline for up to
  `MAX_FREEZE` (60 ms) of frame time. A running freeze can grow but never past 60 ms from its start,
  however many hits ask; the next one waits `FREEZE_GAP` (0.25 s). With Reduce Motion it does
  nothing. A paused game keeps its freeze for when it resumes. Visual time then lags frame time by
  the freeze; nothing catches up (effects are not tied to the sim clock).
- `clock.slowMo(scale, seconds)`: the visuals run at `scale` (0.1–1) for up to 1.2 s of frame time.
- `renderer.visualClock`: a read-only snapshot for e2e, captures and debugging.
- The sim never reads the clock and the clock never reads the sim (the clock test checks that
  `tools/simId.mjs` hashes no `src/render/` file).

Attack FX: `attackFx.update(visualDt, frameDt)` — the game-speed estimate (previews without an
explicit `setTimeScale`) uses the frame time, everything drawn uses the visual time.

## Seeded visual randomness (`src/render/vfx/random.js`)

`createVisualRandom(seed)` is a small seeded generator (mulberry32) with `range`, `int`, `signed`,
`pick`, `chance`, `fork(label)`, `reseed(seed)` and `state`. The renderer makes one battle stream
seeded from the map and stage (`visualSeed('battle', map.id, stage.id)`, or `opts.visualSeed`) and
hands each layer its own fork, so more effects in one layer never shift another layer's numbers:

| Layer | Stream |
|---|---|
| particles (`FxSystem.rand`) | `fork('fx')` |
| attack FX (`ctx.rand`) | `fork('attackFx')` |
| actors (`Actors.rand`: water bob phase, projectile trails, tier-5 sparkles, soot) | `fork('actors')` |
| renderer event effects (slash angle, victory petals) | `fork('events')` |
| ambient life (`AmbientSystem.rand`) | its own stream, seeded from the map id |
| geometry jitter (`GeoBuilder`, when a caller passes no `rand`) | a fixed seed per call |

When writing effect code: use the stream you are handed (`ctx.rand()`, `this.rand()`,
`fx.rand()`), never `Math.random()` and never `sim.rng`, and animate with the `dt` you are given.
`tests/render/vfx-random.test.js` fails on any `Math.random` or sim-rng use under `src/render` or
`src/models`, and checks that the same seed draws the same quads.

## Baseline captures (`tools/vfx/capture.mjs`)

```
node tools/vfx/capture.mjs --label baseline --out <dir>     # 844x390 + 1280x720 × high/medium/low
node tools/vfx/capture.mjs --repeat                         # also re-stages the first config and checks the pictures match
node tools/vfx/capture.mjs --repeat --repeat-config 1280x720:high   # … or that config
node tools/vfx/capture.mjs --out <dir> --resume             # keep what a stopped / crashed run into <dir> finished
node tools/vfx/capture.mjs --viewports 844x390 --qualities high --seconds 5 --reduce-motion
```

It stages the same busy Sandbox battle every time (Sakura Court; eight girls at tier 3–5 and a
level-20 Hikari; ~40 enemies spread along the road with 40× HP, an elite and the Ashwing Matriarch),
then saves, per viewport and quality, the page and the 3D canvas at frames 120 and 180 (2 s and
3 s of play), a device-resolution copy on the phone (DPR 3), the renderer's draw calls / triangles /
attack-FX quads at each moment, and ~10 s of real-time frame times (median and p95 frame interval
and frame-callback CPU time) with a fresh crowd on the board. Output: `capture.json` plus PNGs
(default `e2e/out/vfx/<label>/`, git-ignored).

Why the pictures repeat: the page's `requestAnimationFrame` and `performance.now` are replaced by a
stepped clock before the battle mounts (every frame is exactly 1/60 s), the sim's random stream is
reset to a fixed seed before anything happens, enemy models are loaded before the first frame, the
renderer's randomness is seeded and all its animation runs on the visual clock. Toasts (real-time
UI) are hidden in the shots. `--repeat` proves it: the canvas pixels of the two runs must match
(on high, SwiftShader's float bloom / multisample resolve can leave a handful of pixels ±1 of 255
apart between runs; that counts as the same, anything more does not). A page that crashes (it
happens to headless SwiftShader under load) is staged again once, in a fresh browser if needed.

Besides the real-time numbers, each config reports its stepped frames: the same 180 frames every
run, each finished on the GPU (`gl.finish`) before the next, minus the first few (shader
compiles) — steadier for comparing builds than real-time play. Both are slowed by whatever else
the machine is doing, so `capture.json` records the load average next to them.

The frame times are headless Chromium drawing WebGL on the CPU (SwiftShader): good for comparing two
builds on the same machine, not a stand-in for a real phone (the plan's FPS check on a real
mid-range phone still applies).
